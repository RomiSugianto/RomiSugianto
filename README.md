### 👋Hello there, I'm Romi Sugianto!

I'm a DevOps engineer with a passion for automating and streamlining processes to improve efficiency and reliability in software development. With a background in backend software engineering and experience in network engineering, I bring a diverse skill set to the world of DevOps.

#### 🎓 Teaching Journey:
After graduating, I embarked on a journey to deepen my understanding of DevOps principles and practices. Along the way, I discovered the joy of sharing knowledge and empowering others. Currently, I'm actively involved in teaching college students at my uni about DevOps concepts, believing that teaching is the best way to solidify my own understanding of the subject.

#### 💻 What I Do:
- **DevOps Engineering**: I specialize in configuring Kubernetes clusters, managing Docker containers, implementing GitOps workflows, and utilizing tools like Portainer and ArgoCD to streamline development and deployment processes.
- **Continuous Learning**: As a perpetual learner, I'm always exploring new technologies and methodologies in the ever-evolving landscape of DevOps.
- **Side Projects**: In my free time, I enjoy working on automation projects to enhance productivity and explore innovative solutions to everyday challenges.
